# Welcome to Astrocom

Astromcom is a comic book reader and local download application, which works in tandem with a flask backend and MongoDB, which I know is inherently non-sensical as this is supposed to be a standalone app. Now in order to get this app functioning, I should have migrated the storage of the downloaded pages to the front-end and allowed for a cache of chapter information to be stored in the device itself. I will device a better solution later, for now, this is what it is. Thanks for trying it out for the two people who will actually go through the bother.
